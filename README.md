💬 Veysha Display App

Developed by AURALIS SYSTEMS

Veysha Display is a minimal, fast, and accessible communication tool designed for environments where speaking is difficult or impossible (e.g., loud locations, medical situations, or for non-verbal communication).

This app allows users to quickly type a message and display it in large, full-screen text, which can be instantly flipped for easier readability by another person standing opposite the user.

✨ Key Features

Instant Fullscreen Display: Enlarges text to fill the entire screen for maximum visibility.

Zero Latency: Built with React/Vite for snappy performance, even on older mobile devices.

Mirror Mode (Flip): Instantly flips the displayed text 180 degrees, ensuring the person across from the device can read it easily.

Mobile-First PWA: Optimized for installation directly onto the home screen of iOS and Android devices, behaving like a native application.

Theme Persistence: Remembers user's dark/light mode and color choice.

Quick Pops: Pre-set button phrases for rapid communication.
