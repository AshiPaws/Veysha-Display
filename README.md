💬 Veysha Display: An Accessible Communication Tool

A Minimalist PWA Developed by AURALIS SYSTEMS

Veysha Display is a fast, highly accessible application designed to facilitate communication when speaking is difficult, impossible, or inappropriate (e.g., in loud industrial settings, quiet medical environments, or for non-verbal users).

This application is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to install instantly and run full-screen on any mobile device.

✨ Core Features & Design Philosophy

The application provides a polished, modern interface focused entirely on quick, clear visual output.
