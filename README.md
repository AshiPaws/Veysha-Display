💬 Veysha Display: An Accessible Communication Tool

A Minimalist PWA Developed by AURALIS SYSTEMS

Veysha Display is a fast, highly accessible application designed to facilitate communication when speaking is difficult, impossible, or inappropriate (e.g., in loud industrial settings, quiet medical environments, or for non-verbal users). This application is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to install instantly and run full-screen on any mobile device.

✨ Core Features & Design Philosophy
The application provides a polished, modern interface focused entirely on quick, clear visual output.

Primary User Interface
The main screen is designed for high contrast and quick input, minimizing clutter for communication urgency.

Mirror Mode (Flip): Tapping the Flip button instantly rotates the text 180 degrees, allowing a person standing opposite the user to read the message easily.

Custom Quick Pop Categories: Added the ability to customize and rename the Quick Pop categories (e.g., Core, Needs, Feelings).

Settings and Customization
Users can personalize the appearance and function via the Settings panel. This includes comprehensive theming options and category management.
System-Wide Theming: Supports dynamic Dark Mode (default) and Light Mode.
Secret 'Cyber Void' Theme: Unlocked via a specific interaction, this theme provides a unique high-contrast, blue-purple aesthetic in both Dark and Light modes.
